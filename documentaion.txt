1. Collect source of dataset from Kaggle
2. Split data set 70:15:15 (Train - Validation - Testing)
3. Train the model into .pth file with CNN Method complete with the label using [train.py]
4. After training complete, test it using [main.py]

Options
1. Do data collection by myself run the dataCollection.py and record each letter by urself for the dataset
----
1. Use data set from internet (which i get from Kaggle)

Current Feature
1. Python version i use [3.10.0], make sure your python version compatible with each feature i have
2. Split data set you can run [splitDataSet.py], you can adjust the data set into whatever you want
3. Check availability camera IN CASE you have external camera. You can run [cameraAvailability.py]

Feature Update
1. Know moving letter such as 'J' and 'Z'
2. Know word or sentences
3. Feedback AI Error, if in case either letter, word, or sentences given false prediction
